## Inspiration
User authentication is a fundamental component in most computer security contexts. It provides the basis for access control and user accountability. While there are various types of user authentication systems, alphanumerical username/passwords are the most common type of user authentication. They are versatile and easy to implement and use.
<br>The inspiration for this project was that the traditional way of password authentication doesn't seem interesting and is not secure in many ways like shoulder surfing.

## What it does
### Basic Flow
#### While Registering
Here we gather information like colour, password,first name, last name and email while registering a new user, store it in database.
#### While Login
Here we use graphical method to take the password from the user so to prevent shoulder surfing.Shoulder surfing is using direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone's shoulder, to get information.
So even if someone is observing or shoulder surfing your password, we can protect our password using this graphical method.

## Run 

```bash
npx nodemon server.js
```
or
```bash
node server.js
```
